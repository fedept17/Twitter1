The submission for this project comprehends all the domcuments and files present in the folder /Twitter1.

Altough, during the project implementation the use of GitHub was made by the members of the group to create a very efficient and direct enviroment where everyone was able to collaborate effectivly on the latest version of the software. Therefore we also wanted to include this repository in the submission, even if not part of the main submission.
